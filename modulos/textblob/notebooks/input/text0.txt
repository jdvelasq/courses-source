Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns
in data. Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies
on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming and operations research
to quantify performance.

Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business
performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include predictive analytics, prescriptive
analytics, enterprise decision management, descriptive analytics, cognitive analytics, Big
Data Analytics, retail analytics, store assortment and stock-keeping unit optimization,
marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling, web analytics, call analytics, speech
analytics, sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive
science, credit risk analysis, and fraud analytics. Since analytics can require extensive
computation (see big data), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most
current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.
