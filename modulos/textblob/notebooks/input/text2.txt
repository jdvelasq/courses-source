Data analytics (DA) is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions
about the information they contain, increasingly with the aid of specialized systems
and software. Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial
industries to enable organizations to make more-informed business decisions and by
scientists and researchers to verify or disprove scientific models, theories and
hypotheses.
