Currently, the `ClusterCoordinator` only works with `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`.\n",

The queued functions will be dispatched to remote workers in background threads and their `RemoteValue`s will be filled asynchronously. Since `schedule` doesn’t require worker assignment, the `tf.function` passed in can be executed on any available worker. If the worker it is executed on becomes unavailable before its completion, the function will be retried on another available worker. Because of this fact and the fact that function execution is not atomic, a function may be executed more than once.\n",
